# Checkpoint: x821

**Date:** 2025
**Branch:** droid

## Current Status

Project scanned and reviewed. News system examined across all apps.

## Upcoming Changes

Planning to implement news categorization system:
- Holiday: başlıkta "holiday" + All Day + null
- Speech/Konuşma: saat + null  
- All Day açıklamalar: All Day + null
- Normal veri açıklama: normal veri

This categorization will be applied to:
- app48
- app72
- app80
- app120
- app321
- app120/iou

Goal: All news types will be displayed in IOU/IOV tables, but only Normal data events will affect XYZ filtering. Holiday, Speech, and AllDay events will be informational only.

## Current State

All apps successfully pulling news from news_data/ directory. Ready for categorization implementation.
